        <p>The datasets that I decided to map and visualize were Toronto Neighbourhood Crime Rates of 2023, and Police Facility Locations in Toronto. By doing this, it provided valuable insights into the city's safety and security. This data was categorized and analyzed to identify patterns and trends. Additionally, the locations of police facilities, including precincts and community policing offices, were mapped to examine their spatial distribution in relation to crime hotspots.</p>

<p>Firstly, when analyzing the neighborhood crime rates, the cities with the greatest crime documented in 2023 were West-Humber Clairville, Downtown Yonge East, York University Heights, Yonge-Bay Corridor, and more as shown in the infographic and map. This for me, raised questions like what are their economic and social conditions? In contrast, what are those same conditions like in the neighborhoods with lower crime rates? Looking at more datasets, I find out that the cities with higher crime rates generally have lower income, a higher rate of immigrants, and unsuitable housing. In the neighborhoods with lower crime rates, living conditions and economic status improves. </p>

<p>Next, when analyzing locations of police facilities in toronto, I find that the areas with the most concentrated percentage of crime, have the most concentrated amount of police facilities. For example, when analyzing the map, I can see that within the top 10 neighborhoods with the greatest crime rate, the area containing the neighborhoods of Downtown Yonge East, Wellington Place, Kensington Chinatown, Moss Park, and Yonge-Bay Corridor have 4 police facilities within at least a 2 km radius.</p>
      
<p>This finding mapped out a relation between the two datasets that I had predicted; the neighborhoods with a higher crime rate have more police facilities. That is because I assumed that  police facilities would stay around areas that have more crime for accessibility.  However, other areas like West-Humber Clairville or Etobicoke City Centre are relatively underserved. This makes me wonder if the higher rate of crime is due to the fact that there is not enough surveillance and policing being done in those areas. </p>

<p>The visualization and mapping of Toronto's 2023 neighborhood crime rates and police facility locations underscore the need for strategic planning in law enforcement and community safety initiatives. This approach not only highlights areas requiring immediate attention but also aids in the formulation of effective strategies for the city of Toronto.
